# TicTacToad: Terminal Based Minigames
### Berwin Lan, Emma Mack, Maya Sivanandan

## Project Goals
* Lower bound: We would like two computers on the same network to be able to play rock-paper-scissors through the command line.
* Stretch goal(s): Implementing more complex games (i.e. tic-tac-toe), implementing more users, GUI

## Learning Goals
* Berwin: Improving and expanding my skills in C, building a basic understanding of how computers communicate across a network
* Maya: Understanding how to have two computers communicate in real time and increase my general competency in C
* Emma: Understanding computer networking, getting more practice with pointers, learning about information flows (e.g. stdin)

## Resources
* We were inspired by this past project, which focuses more on the computer networking aspect of what we’re hoping to accomplish. We can start with their cited resources: https://github.com/NathanShuster/hackerchat/blob/master/reports/report.md#resources
* Socket programming:

## First steps
* Conceptual understanding of the computer networking we plan on doing (Berwin). Creating reading list for socket programming; while this will be an ongoing learning process, our goal is for each member of the team to have a conceptual understanding of our computer networking. This task will be done when all members of the team have completed the readings.
* Set up basic connection between two machines on the same network (Maya, but all working closely). After completing this, we will be able to start up two command shells on separate machines and have them communicate with one another over the same network.
* Write a minigame for two players that’s run on one machine (Emma). This is complete when there is a functional version of rock-paper-scissors in the terminal of a single device.
