# TicTacToad
A cross-machine minigame program

## 2/24/2022
* Ran socket_test.c from Emma's computer as server and Berwin and Maya's WSLs as clients, which WORKED!
* `hostname -i` to get a machine's IP address, which changes when you change Wifi networks
    * Maya and Berwin have the same address, which suggests that it might be an IP address thing
* need to `printf` with `\n` smh
* implemented receiving input from a client and storing it in a buffer
