# TicTacToad
A cross-machine minigame program

## 2/24/2022
* Ran socket_test.c from Emma's computer as server and Berwin and Maya's WSLs as clients, which WORKED!
* `hostname -i` to get a machine's IP address, which changes when you change Wifi networks
    * Maya and Berwin have the same address, which suggests that it might be an IP address thing
    * Maya on OLIN is `10.7.88.62`
* need to `printf` with `\n` smh
* implemented most of 20Q
* Blocked by not understanding why `strcmp` isn't working, will address during first check-in (2/25)
* WSL can connect to itself, but not between different machines
